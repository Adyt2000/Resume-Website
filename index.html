          <h3>Team Work & Critical Thinking</h3>
          <p>
            Team work is one of the most important skills that everyone should have
            that is the reason why Marymount University was conducting a lot of
            team work exercises for in person classes and online classes.
            Critical thinking is another most important skill since we should know
            how to take good decision during important times.

            My first time learning about database and how databases work was in my
            junior year in college. I have a verry nice professor that was teaching
            me how databases are working and why they are important in a business.
            She also taught me how to code and create a database.
